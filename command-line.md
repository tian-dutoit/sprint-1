Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command line is a way for you to interact directly with your computer. In the same way you would use your mouse and keyboard to navigate through and change things on your desktop, you can give various commands for your computer to carry out through the command line. However, the command line only takes text as an input and will provide feedback via text on the terminal.  

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
pwd - Stands for "print working directory". This will tell the terminal to print out the current directory you are working in.
ls - Lists the files that are inside of the directory that you are in.  
cd - Changes the directory (folder) you are in.
cp - Copies files or directories.
rm - Removes files or directories.
mw - Moves files. You can also use it to rename a file.
cat - Lets you view the output of a file.
sort - Alphabetically sorts the information contained in the file or directory.
sed - Works in a similar way to 'find and replace'. You specify the the word you want to find and the word you want to replace it with.
>> - Takes the output of what goes before it and appends it to the file that goes after it.
